**Outcome Die:**
- Y+ ↔ N+ (Strong results)
- Y ↔ N (Simple results)
- Y- ↔ N- (Qualified results)

**Scene Die:**
- CT ↔ SP (Physical/Magical opposition)
- MV ↔ MT (Motion/Material opposition)
- SC ↔ KN (Social/Information opposition)

## Construction Process

## Part 2: Rules and Usage

## Core Mechanics

### Basic Principle
The oracle system provides answers and context for GM-style decisions in solo play, working alongside existing RPG rules rather than replacing them. The system supports both standard rolls and advantage/disadvantage mechanics from various game systems.

### Dice Functions

**Likelihood Die:**
- Green (+): Take the better outcome between the Outcome die result and its opposite face
- Red (-): Take the worse outcome between the Outcome die result and its opposite face
- Only use when probability isn't clear from fiction

**Outcome Die:**
- Y+ (Yes, And...): Strong positive with additional benefit
- Y (Yes): Simple positive
- Y- (Yes, But...): Positive with complication
- N- (No, But...): Negative with silver lining
- N (No): Simple negative
- N+ (No, And...): Strong negative with additional complication

**Scene Die:**
- CT (Combat): Physical conflict, violence, danger
- MV (Move): Location, distance, terrain, weather
- SC (Social): NPCs, factions, relationships
- KN (Knowledge): Information, secrets, mysteries
- MT (Material): Items, resources, objects
- SP (Supernatural): Magic, weird events, unexplained

## Advantage/Disadvantage Rules

### Basic Principle
When a game system grants advantage or disadvantage, apply this to any die roll using the opposite face mechanic.

### Implementation
**With Advantage:**
1. Roll the die
2. Check the opposite face
3. Take the more favorable result

**With Disadvantage:**
1. Roll the die
2. Check the opposite face
3. Take the less favorable result

### Examples
**Outcome Die with Advantage:**
- Roll Y- (Yes, But...)
- Opposite face is N- (No, But...)
- Take Y- as more favorable

**Scene Die with Advantage:**
- Roll CT (Combat)
- Opposite face is SP (Supernatural)
- Choose more advantageous context

## Standard Usage Guidelines

### When to Roll

**Quick Check (1 Die):**
- Simple yes/no questions
- Clear probability situations
- Basic environmental details
- Immediate reactions

**Standard Scene (2 Dice):**
- Common situations needing context
- NPC reactions
- Discovery moments
- Environmental exploration

**Complex Scene (3 Dice):**
- Major plot points
- Unclear probability situations
- Critical decisions
- Key narrative moments

### When Not to Roll
- For established facts
- When outcome is obvious
- For system-specific rules
- When regular game mechanics apply
- For previously determined elements

## Resolution Process

### Basic Check (1 Die):
1. State the question
2. Roll Outcome die
3. Check for advantage/disadvantage
4. Interpret final result

### Standard Check (2 Dice):
1. State the question
2. Roll Outcome and Scene dice
3. Check for advantage/disadvantage
4. Apply any face oppositions
5. Interpret combined result

### Complex Check (3 Dice):
1. State the question
2. Roll all three dice
3. Apply Likelihood modifier
4. Check for advantage/disadvantage
5. Determine final faces
6. Interpret complete result

## Result Interpretation

### Reading Outcomes
**Basic Results:**
- Y+: "Yes, and something additional happens in your favor"
- Y: "Yes, it happens as expected"
- Y-: "Yes, but there's a complication"
- N-: "No, but something positive still occurs"
- N: "No, it doesn't happen"
- N+: "No, and there's an additional problem"

### Scene Applications
**Context Interpretations:**
- CT: Combat or danger-related implications
- MV: Movement or environmental factors
- SC: Social or interpersonal elements
- KN: Information or mystery elements
- MT: Physical objects or resources
- SP: Magical or unexplained aspects

## Integration with RPG Systems

### For Various Systems:
- D&D 5E: Use advantage/disadvantage directly
- Call of Cthulhu: Hard/Regular/Easy rolls
- Powered by the Apocalypse: +/-1 forward
- Fate: Aspect invocations
- Other systems: Adapt as needed

## Best Practices

### General Guidelines:
1. Let fiction guide likelihood
2. Apply advantage/disadvantage consistently
3. Build on previous results
4. Note significant outcomes
5. Trust the narrative flow

### Common Pitfalls:
1. Over-rolling
2. Ignoring fiction
3. Breaking game logic
4. Forcing interpretations
5. Neglecting regular game rules

### Record Keeping
Keep a simple log:
```

## Part 3: Extended Examples and Play Scenarios

## Basic Examples

### Quick Check Example
**Situation:** "Is the market still open?"
```
Roll: Outcome Die - Y- (Yes, But...)
Interpretation: Yes, the market is open, but merchants are 
starting to pack up for the day.
```

### Standard Check Example
**Situation:** "Do I notice anything unusual about the tavern?"
```
Outcome Die: N- (No, But...)
Scene Die: SC (Social)
Interpretation: No, the tavern seems normal, but you notice the 
usually chatty bartender keeps glancing nervously at a group of patrons.
```

### Complex Check with Advantage Example
**Situation:** "Can I spot any weaknesses in the guard patrol? (With advantage due to local knowledge)"
```
Likelihood: + (Positive)
Outcome: Roll N-, opposite face Y- (take Y- due to advantage)
Scene: MV (Move)
Interpretation: Yes, you spot a gap in the patrol route, but it's 
weather-dependent and only useful during rainy nights.
```

## System-Specific Examples

### D&D 5E Style
**Situation:** "Attempting to persuade the merchant (with Advantage from Charm Person)"
```
Roll: N (No)
Opposite Face: Y (Yes)
Scene: SC (Social)
Take: Y (due to advantage)
Interpretation: Yes, the charmed merchant agrees to your request, 
and the Social context suggests they're genuinely friendly about it.
```

### Call of Cthulhu Style
**Situation:** "Searching the professor's office (Hard roll made Regular by using a flashlight)"
```
Roll: N+ (No, And...)
Opposite Face: Y+ (Yes, And...)
Scene: KN (Knowledge)
Take: Y+ (due to improved circumstances)
Interpretation: Yes, you find crucial documents, and the Knowledge 
context reveals additional unexpected connections.
```

### Powered by the Apocalypse Style
**Situation:** "Acting under pressure (+1 forward from previous move)"
```
Roll: N- (No, But...)
Opposite Face: Y- (Yes, But...)
Scene: CT (Combat)
Take: Y- (due to bonus)
Interpretation: Yes, you manage the dangerous maneuver, but the 
Combat context suggests you've drawn unwanted attention.
```

## Extended Play Scenario
Let's follow a complete scene using multiple oracle interactions.

### Scene: Investigating Mysterious Tower

**Initial Question:** "Is the tower entrance accessible?"
```
Roll: Outcome - N- (No, But...)
Scene: MT (Material)
Interpretation: No, the door is barred, but you notice some 
climbing gear left behind by previous visitors.
```

**Follow-up with Advantage (due to finding gear):** "Can I find another way in?"
```
Roll: Y- (Yes, But...)
Opposite Face: N- (No, But...)
Scene: MV (Move)
Take: Y- (due to advantage)
Interpretation: Yes, you find a scalable section, but the 
Movement context suggests it's exposed to public view.
```

**Investigation (with Likelihood):** "Are there signs of recent visitors?"
```
Likelihood: + (due to finding gear)
Outcome: N vs Y (take Y due to +)
Scene: KN (Knowledge)
Interpretation: Yes, you find recent tracks and the Knowledge 
context reveals they appear to be from multiple different groups.
```

## Genre-Specific Examples

### Fantasy Example
**Setting:** Exploring ancient ruins
```
Q: "Does the ancient mechanism still work?"
L: - (aged mechanism suggests negative)
O: Y vs N (Take N due to negative)
S: SP (Supernatural)
Result: No, the mechanism is inert, and the Supernatural context 
suggests magical wards have finally faded.
```

### Horror Example
**Setting:** Investigating haunted house
```
Q: "Is the strange noise coming from upstairs?"
O: Y- (Yes, But...)
S: KN (Knowledge)
Result: Yes, the sound is from upstairs, but your Knowledge of 
the house layout tells you that's an exterior wall with no rooms.
```

### Sci-Fi Example
**Setting:** Hacking security system
```
Q: "Can I bypass the security? (with advantage from specialized tools)"
O: N- to Y- (take Y- due to advantage)
S: MT (Material)
Result: Yes, you can bypass it, but the Material context suggests 
some physical component is damaged in the process.
```

## Tips for Interpretation

### Combining Scene Types with Outcomes

**Combat (CT)**
- With Y+: Advantageous tactical situation
- With Y-: Success with tactical complication
- With N+: Dangerous combat escalation

**Movement (MV)**
- With Y+: Perfect positioning achieved
- With Y-: Path found but exposed
- With N+: Position compromised

**Social (SC)**
- With Y+: Strong relationship impact
- With Y-: Social success with strings
- With N+: Relationship damaged

**Knowledge (KN)**
- With Y+: Crucial insight gained
- With Y-: Partial but useful info
- With N+: Dangerous misconception

**Material (MT)**
- With Y+: Resource gain and opportunity
- With Y-: Limited resource access
- With N+: Resource depletion or loss

**Supernatural (SP)**
- With Y+: Magical breakthrough
- With Y-: Unstable magical effect
- With N+: Magical backlash

## Campaign Integration Tips

1. Keep a log of major oracle results
2. Connect Scene die results to ongoing plots
3. Use advantage/disadvantage to reflect character growth
4. Let the oracle inspire but not dictate
5. Build on established world elements
6. Use Likelihood sparingly for truly uncertain moments

- (+) with ST/GR: Take more helpful resource
- (+) with PP/IN: Take more reliable contact/info

## Creating Custom Sets

### Face Mapping Guidelines
1. Top face is primary action/conflict
2. Middle band contains common elements
3. Bottom face is supernatural/special element
4. Maintain opposite face relationships

### Likelihood Integration
When creating a custom set, ensure each face pair has clear:
- Better/worse outcomes for Likelihood modification
- Advantage/disadvantage interpretations
- Consistent probability balance

### Face Pair Design Template
```
       A1
    B1  C1  B2
       C2
       A2
```
Where:
- A1/A2: Primary opposition pair
- B1/B2: Resource/environment pair
- C1/C2: Information/social pair

## Alternative Set Usage Examples

### Fantasy Example with Likelihood
```
Question: "Is the magical trap still active?"
Likelihood: + (well-maintained dungeon)
Scene Roll: DG (Dungeon)
Opposite Face: NP (NPCs)
Result: With +, take more relevant face for trap status
```

### Horror Example with Likelihood
```
Question: "Do we find useful evidence?"
Likelihood: - (scene was cleaned)
Scene Roll: EV (Evidence)
Opposite Face: HT (Hunt)
Result: With -, take less helpful investigation outcome
```

## Implementation Tips

### Switching Between Sets
- Keep reference sheet with face maps
- Note Likelihood interactions
- Maintain thematic consistency
- Document face positions

### Genre Adaptation
- Choose set before session
- Stay consistent within scenes
- Allow for genre blending when appropriate
- Consider campaign impact

### Face Position Verification
For any set, verify:
1. Primary conflict at top
2. Related elements paired
3. Special/supernatural at bottom
4. Clear better/worse outcomes for Likelihood

## Custom Set Creation Worksheet

### Step 1: Map Positions
```
       ___
    ___  ___  ___
       ___
       ___
```

### Step 2: Define Pairs
