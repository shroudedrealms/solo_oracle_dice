Likelihood Die:        Outcome Die:           Scene Die:
       1(+)                Y+                    CT
   2(+) 3(+) 5(-)     Y   Y-  N             MV  SC  MT
       4(-)                N-                    KN
       6(-)                N+                    SP
```

## Core Mechanics

**Opposite Face Rule** (faces sum to 7)
- Face 1 ↔ Face 6
- Face 2 ↔ Face 5
- Face 3 ↔ Face 4

**Likelihood Die**
- Green (+): Take better result
- Red (-): Take worse result

**Advantage/Disadvantage**
- Advantage: Check opposite face, take better result
- Disadvantage: Check opposite face, take worse result

## Basic Results

**Outcome Die**
- Y+ : Yes, And... (strong positive)
- Y  : Yes (simple positive)
- Y- : Yes, But... (qualified positive)
- N- : No, But... (qualified negative)
- N  : No (simple negative)
- N+ : No, And... (strong negative)

**Scene Die**
- CT: Combat/Violence (physical conflict, danger)
- MV: Movement (location, distance, terrain)
- SC: Social (NPCs, factions, relationships)
- KN: Knowledge (information, secrets, mysteries)
- MT: Material (items, resources, objects)
- SP: Supernatural (magic, weird events, unexplained)

## When to Roll

**One Die (Outcome)**
- Simple yes/no questions
- Clear probability situations
- Quick checks
- Basic environmental details

**Two Dice (Outcome + Scene)**
- Need context
- Scene development
- NPC reactions
- Discovery moments
- Exploration results

**Three Dice (All)**
- Unclear probability
- Major decisions
- Critical moments
- Complex situations
- Key narrative points

## Common Combinations

**Combat Results (CT)**
- Y+ CT: Perfect tactical advantage
- Y  CT: Successful combat action
- Y- CT: Success with tactical setback
- N- CT: Failed action with opportunity
- N  CT: Complete combat failure
- N+ CT: Failure with tactical disadvantage

**Social Results (SC)**
- Y+ SC: Strong alliance formed
- Y  SC: Positive social interaction
- Y- SC: Conditional agreement
- N- SC: Rejection with silver lining
- N  SC: Social connection failed
- N+ SC: New adversary made

**Knowledge Results (KN)**
- Y+ KN: Critical information gained
- Y  KN: Clear information found
- Y- KN: Partial or unclear info
- N- KN: Dead end with new lead
- N  KN: No information found
- N+ KN: Misleading information

## System Integration

**D&D 5E Style**
- Use advantage/disadvantage directly
- Scene die guides skill check interpretation
- Likelihood for uncertain situations

**Call of Cthulhu Style**
- Hard = Disadvantage
- Regular = Normal roll
- Easy = Advantage

**PbtA Style**
- Use for GM moves
- Scene die guides move selection
- Likelihood for establishing position

## Troubleshooting Guide

**If Stuck...**
1. Return to last clear story point
2. Consider most interesting outcome
3. Let genre guide interpretation
4. Build on previous results
5. Choose dramatic option

**Common Issues**
1. Multiple interpretations possible
   - Choose most relevant to current situation
2. Unclear probability
   - Use Likelihood die
3. Contradictory results
   - Let Scene die guide resolution

## Key Principles

1. Oracle enhances, doesn't replace rules
2. Let fiction guide likelihood
3. Build on established narrative
4. Trust your storytelling instincts
5. Use for inspiration, not limitation

## Remember
- Only roll when outcome uncertain
- Keep interpretations consistent
- Note significant outcomes
- Scene die guides but doesn't limit
- Let narrative flow naturally
